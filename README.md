# AI_Algorithms

This GitHub project contains a collection of artificial intelligence algorithms that had to be implemented as part of the subject "knowledge engineering" ([UCM, Software Engineering](https://informatica.ucm.es/estudios/grado-ingenieriadelsoftware)).

## Getting Started

This project has been developed using Java SE 10, and upgrated periodically to the latest version of Java.

No third-party software is needed to execute runnable files and to mount it in any project editor.

### Prerequisites

To execute the runnable *'.jar'* files, you must have the latest version of [Java](https://www.java.com/es/download/).

To compile and edit the project, you must have the latest [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) installed.

## Documentation

Every JavaScript file is documented, but I'm writing a [wiki page](https://github.com/Juangmar/AI_Algorithms/wiki) with more detailed information, including every info I've found or discovered regarding the API methods and objects.


## Contributing

*AI Algorithms* is an open source project, so anyone can contribute to improve the existing algorithms or implement new ones, and we encourage you to do so.

Even though every pull request will be considered and possibly accepted, there's a [file](CONTRIBUTING.md) to know about some recommendations about the code of conduct, the process of commiting and accepting pull requests, along with some tips about code standards.
